Design Engineering Project
this is the desing engineering project made by students Krutin Trivedi(140770107238) and Shruti Shah(140770107212) in year 2017. This project is on
event display with discription and details related that event. Our main imphasize is on technical events(e.g. workshops, fairs , hackathons, etc.) 
that students are not aware of and miss the golden chance to increse their skills and knowledge. We want to provide a stage to all the students so they
get to know about the surrounding environment and ultimatly get to know each and every events held of their interest. For that we are going to build
an application for them that can have the power to provide all the information they needed to know.
